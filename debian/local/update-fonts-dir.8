.SH NAME
update\-fonts\-dir \- compile fonts.dir files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update\-fonts\-dir
[\fIOPTION\fR]
.I directory ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B update\-fonts\-dir
creates a
.I fonts.dir
file in an X font directory by invoking
.BR mkfontdir (1x)
with the appropriate arguments.
It is typically invoked only from the
post\-installation and post\-removal scripts of a
.I package
containing fonts for the X Window System, but may be invoked at any time to
reconstruct
.I fonts.dir
files.
For each
.IR directory ,
which is simply the last component of its path (such as \(oq75dpi\(cq or
\(oqmisc\(cq),
.B update\-fonts\-dir
will generate either
.IR /usr/lib/X11/fonts/ directory /fonts.dir
or
.IR /usr/share/fonts/X11/ directory /fonts.dir
from the
.I fonts.scale
and font files found within it.
.PP
This enables multiple packages to provide names for fonts in the same
directory.
No font package actually provides the
.I fonts.dir
file in the X font directory itself, so there is no danger of overwriting
one package's font names with those of another.
.PP
For instance, the two packages \(oqxfonts\-base\(cq (real) and
\(oqxfonts\-nifty\(cq (hypothetical) may both install fonts into the
directory
.IR /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc ,
and
.B update\-fonts\-dir
will ensure that the
.I fonts.dir
file in that directory contains information about the font files provided
by both packages.
.PP
The format of
.I fonts.dir
files is described in the
.BR mkfontdir (1x)
manual page.
.PP
An example of how to use
.B update\-fonts\-dir
in package maintainer scripts is provided in the Debian Policy Manual.
.SH OPTIONS
.B \-h\fR, \fB\-\-help
displays a brief usage message and exits.
.PP
.B \-7\fR, \fB\-\-x11r7\-layout
switches the font layout to the one introduced in X11R7: fonts in 
.IR /usr/share/fonts/X11/ directory 
(default is: fonts in 
.IR /usr/lib/X11/fonts/ directory)
.SH OPERANDS
.B update\-fonts\-dir
takes one or more X font directory names to operate on as operands.
Only the final path component of the directory name should be specified;
e.g.,
.RS
.B update\-fonts\-dir 75dpi
.RE
is correct, while
.RB \(oq "update\-fonts\-dir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi" \(cq
and
.RB \(oq "update\-fonts\-dir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi" \(cq
are not.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B COLUMNS
indicates the width of the terminal device in character cells.
This value is used for formatting diagnostic messages.
If not set, the terminal is queried using
.BR stty (1)
to determine its width.
If that fails, a value of \(oq80\(cq is assumed.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SS Errors
.TP
.B usage error: one or more font directories must be provided
.B update\-fonts\-dir
was invoked without operands.
Supply one or more X font directory names to operate on.
.TP
.B usage error: unrecognized option
.B update\-fonts\-dir
was invoked with an unrecognized option argument.
Use only the options documented in \(lqOPTIONS\(rq, above.
.TP
.B fatal error: path to X font directory must be used
A directory name was supplied that was not an X font directory name.
Supply X font directory names only.
.SS Warnings
.TP
.BI "warning: absolute path " directory " was provided"
Usage of absolute paths is deprecated.
Use only the final component of the X font directory name for
.IR directory .
.TP
.BI "warning: " directory " does not exist or is not a directory"
The supplied
.I directory
was invalid.
.B update\-fonts\-dir
skipped it.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP

.B update\-fonts\-dir
ran successfully.
.TP
1
.B update\-fonts\-dir
experienced a fatal error; see the section on diagnostic messages above.
.TP
