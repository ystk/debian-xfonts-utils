.SH NAME
update\-fonts\-scale \- generate fonts.scale files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update\-fonts\-scale
[\fIOPTION\fR]
.I directory ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B update\-fonts\-scale
assembles a
.I fonts.scale
file in an X font directory using one or more scale files found in a
subdirectory of
.IR /etc/X11/fonts/ .
It is typically invoked only from the post\-installation and post\-removal
scripts of a package containing scalable fonts usable by the X Window
System whose X LFD font names are not in the font files themselves, but may
be invoked at any time to reconstruct
.I fonts.scale
files.
For each
.IR directory ,
which is either an absolute path to an X font directory or (preferably)
simply the last component of its path (such as \(oq75dpi\(cq or
\(oqmisc\(cq),
.B update\-fonts\-scale
will assemble either
.IR /usr/lib/X11/fonts/ directory /fonts.scale
or
.IR /usr/share/fonts/X11/ directory /fonts.scale
from the index files found at
.IR /etc/X11/fonts/ directory / package .scale ,
where
.I package
is the name of the package installing the fonts.
.PP
This enables multiple packages to provide names for fonts in the same
directory.
No font package actually provides the
.I fonts.scale
file in the X font directory itself, so there is no danger of overwriting
one package's font names with those of another.
.PP
For instance, the two packages \(oqxfonts\-scalable\(cq (real) and
\(oqxfonts\-nifty\(cq (hypothetical) may both install fonts into the
directory
.IR /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 .
They each place their
.I fonts.scale
files in
.I /etc/X11/fonts/Type1/xfonts\-scalable.scale
and
.I /etc/X11/fonts/Type1/xfonts\-nifty.scale
(respectively).
.B update\-fonts\-scale
concatenates these two files (as well as any others that match
.IR /etc/X11/fonts/Type1/*.scale )
into
.IR /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/fonts.scale .
.PP
The format for
.I fonts.scale
files is given in the
.BR mkfontdir (1x)
manual page.
.PP
An example of how to use
.B update\-fonts\-scale
in package maintainer scripts is provided in the Debian Policy Manual.
.SH OPTIONS
.B \-h\fR, \fB\-\-help
displays a brief usage message and exits.
.SH OPERANDS
.B update\-fonts\-scale
takes one or more X font directory names to operate on as operands.
Only the final path component of the directory name should be specified;
e.g.,
.RS
.B update\-fonts\-scale 75dpi
.RE
is correct, while
.RB \(oq "update\-fonts\-scale /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi" \(cq
and
.RB \(oq "update\-fonts\-scale /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi" \(cq
are not.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B COLUMNS
indicates the width of the terminal device in character cells.
This value is used for formatting diagnostic messages.
If not set, the terminal is queried using
.BR stty (1)
to determine its width.
If that fails, a value of \(oq80\(cq is assumed.
.TP
.B DEBUG
determines whether low\-level diagnostic messages are issued to standard error
output.
A null (empty) or unset value indicates that they are not, and a non\-null
value indicates that they are.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SS Errors
.TP
.B usage error: one or more font directories must be provided
.B update\-fonts\-scale
was invoked without operands.
Supply one or more X font directory names to operate on.
.TP
.B usage error: unrecognized option
.B update\-fonts\-scale
was invoked with an unrecognized option argument.
Use only the options documented in \(lqOPTIONS\(rq, above.
.TP
.B fatal error: path to X font directory must be used
A directory name was supplied that was not an X font directory name.
Supply X font directory names only.
.SS Warnings
.TP
.BI "warning: absolute path " directory " was provided"
Usage of absolute paths is deprecated.
Use only the final component of the X font directory name for
.IR directory .
.TP
.BI "warning: " directory " does not exist or is not a directory"
The supplied
.I directory
was invalid.
.B update\-fonts\-scale
skipped it.
.SS Notes
Notes are only displayed under special circumstances; see \(lqENVIRONMENT\(rq.
above.
.TP
.BI "note: " index " references nonexistent font file " filename
The index file
.IR /etc/X11/fonts/ directory / package .scale ,
refers to a nonexistent font file,
.IR filename .
This is normal when
.I package
has been removed, but not purged from the system.
In other circumstances, it likely indicates an error in
.IR package .
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
0
.B update\-fonts\-scale
ran successfully.
.TP
1
.B update\-fonts\-scale
experienced a fatal error; see the section on diagnostic messages above.
.TP
2
.B update\-fonts\-scale
was invoked with invalid arguments.
